This program reads a trace and tries to build loop nests that
reproduce the input data. Details of the algorithm can be found in
"Prediction and Trace Compression of Data Access Addresses through
Nested Loop Recognition", by Alain Ketterlin and Philippe Clauss,
at CGO'2008.

To build the executable (named nlr), just type make. There should be
no warning, no error. You need a C99 compliant compiler. I've tried
this on various Linux distributions, with no problem. If you have
trouble compiling nlr, or get warnings or errors, please send me
(Alain) the compiler's output (and problematic lines of code if you
changed the source).

By the way, the code is probably unix-specific, you're on your own if
you try to compile this on a Windows system.

Also, the software is currently full of dead-code, hacks etc. For any
usage other than running it on some traces to look at the output
please contact me, as I have various other versions that may help you
more than this one.

There is a man-page, and it's more or less up-to-date. Type:

    man ./nlr.1

Feel free to contact me if you have any question or need some specific
feature. Also, if you do any serious thing with this code, please let
me know by sending a short description of what you did with it.
